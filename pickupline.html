		<h3>I heard you’re good in algebra, can you replace my X without asking Y
	Can I follow you? Cause my mom told me to follow my dreams
	You know what’s beautiful? Read the first word
	Do you have a name or can I call you mine?
	You look cold. Want to use me as a blanket?
	I know somebody who likes you but if I weren’t so shy, I’d tell you who.
	Most people like to watch the Superbowl cuz it only happens once a year, but Id rather talk to you cause the chance of meeting someone like you only happens once in a lifetime
	(Ask a person for the time) 9:15? So today is May 1, 2008, at 9:15 PM, thanks I just wanted to be able to remember the exact moment that I met the woman of my dreams.
	I want to be your tear drop, so I could be born in your eyes, live on your cheeks, and die on your lips.
	Damn Girl is your name Wifi ? Because I’m feeling a connection! </h3>
		<h1> Bad Ex. </h1>
		<h3>You are almost as hot as my mom.
	You look exactly like my future ex-wife.
	I just wanna let you know how beautiful you are and was wondering if you could buy me a drink?
	She: I’m in a relationship | You: Let’s talk about how we can get you out of that.
	My mom thinks I`m gay, can you help me prove her wrong?</h3>
